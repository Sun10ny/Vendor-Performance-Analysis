Vendor Performance Analysis
This project performs an in-depth analysis of vendor and brand performance using inventory and sales data from a SQLite database. It applies data visualization, statistical techniques, and business logic to identify key insights that can drive procurement strategies, vendor negotiations, and pricing decisions.

üìÅ Project Structure
Data Source: data folder,inventory.db (SQLite database)

Table Used: purchase_price,vendor_invoice,sales,vendor_sales_summary(analyzed)

Tools: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sqlite3, scipy,lookerstudio(instead of Power BI)

üîç Objectives
Evaluate vendor and brand-level sales and profitability

Identify slow-moving products and excess inventory

Analyze bulk purchasing patterns and their impact on cost

Determine underperforming brands with high margin potential

Apply statistical testing to compare vendor performance

üìä Key Analyses Performed
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive statistics and distribution plots

Box plots and histograms to visualize skewness and outliers

Heatmap to uncover correlations between key metrics

2. Brand Optimization Strategy
Identify brands with:

Low Sales (bottom 15%)

High Profit Margins (top 15%)

Target these for promotional strategies or dynamic pricing

3. Top Vendors & Brands
Ranked vendors and brands by total sales

Visualized using annotated bar charts

Applied currency formatting for readability (K, M)

4. Vendor Purchase Contribution (Pareto Analysis)
Calculated % contribution of each vendor to total purchase dollars

Plotted Pareto chart with cumulative contribution

Revealed that Top 10 vendors account for most purchasing

5. Bulk Purchase Impact on Cost
Compared unit price across order sizes (Small, Medium, Large)

Result: Larger orders significantly reduce per-unit cost

6. Inventory & Capital Efficiency
Identified vendors with:

Low stock turnover (<1)

High unsold inventory value

Visualized locked capital per vendor

7. Profitability Confidence Intervals
Compared 95% confidence intervals for profit margins:

Top-performing vendors vs. Low-performing vendors

Revealed interesting trade-off: higher margin ‚â† higher sales

8. Hypothesis Testing (T-Test)
Tested if mean profit margins between top and low performers are significantly different

Result: Statistically significant difference (p < 0.05)

üìå Key Insights
üìâ Some vendors show low turnover, locking capital in unsold inventory.

üí∏ Bulk buying reduces unit costs by up to 72%, boosting profit margins.

üìà Low-selling brands with high margins are ripe for targeted promotion.

üßÆ Top vendors dominate procurement ‚Äî ideal candidates for renegotiation.

üìä Data-backed insights support smarter purchasing and pricing strategies.
